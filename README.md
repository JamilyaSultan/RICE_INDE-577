This repository contains the projects created during Data Science and Machine Learning class at the Rice University during Spring 2022.
In this class we learned about fundamentals of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.

The course covered both Data Science concepts and the mathematical background needed for comprehension.
