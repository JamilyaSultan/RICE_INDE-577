# Single Neuron Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is often used for predictive analytics and modeling, and extends to applications in machine learning. In this analytics approach, the dependent variable is finite or categorical: either A or B (binary regression) or a range of finite options A, B, C or D (multinomial regression). It is used in statistical software to understand the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic regression equation. 

This type of analysis can help you predict the likelihood of an event happening or a choice being made. For example, you may want to know the likelihood of a visitor choosing an offer made on your website — or not (dependent variable). Your analysis can look at known characteristics of visitors, such as sites they came from, repeat visits to your site, behavior on your site (independent variables). Logistic regression models help you determine a probability of what type of visitors are likely to accept the offer — or not. As a result, you can make better decisions about promoting your offer or make decisions about the offer itself.

The figures above demostrate how the Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are different. The Logistic Regression is used for the cases when the data is not linearly separable. Rather then predicting values, the task is to classify.
